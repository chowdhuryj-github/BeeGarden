# The Bee Garden Lab Collection
Welcome to the Bee Garden Lab Collection! This repository is a design patterns project that I've worked on with [Mathias Galvan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-galvan/) during my sophomore year at the Milwaukee School of Engineering!

## Lab Description
The goal of this lab was to develop a simple garden simulator. In this simulator, the bees visit flowers for food, and the flowers can drain energy. The garden will be shown with bees moving above the flower bed. 

## Lab 5 | Desining a Solution
* Created a domain-level class diagram and a sequence diagram that meets all the system requirements
* Ensured the code builds and all project configuration files are pushed and committed
* Developed a report with UML class diagram, sequence diagram and distributed workload with teammate

## Lab 6 | Developing the Simulation
* Added health bars to bees to allow the user to manage between risk and reward of having the bees move to a flower
* Implemented the strategy pattern to allow for better code development using the open/closed principle
* Added GUI enhancements such as displaying a legend, flowers and the bees as well as code logic for bee movement
* Created a interactive button allowing the user to adjust the number of bees and flowers on the flower bed

## Lab 7 | The Final Touches
* Fixed the logic errors behind the health bars of the bees so that they work accordingly when the bee interacts with a flower
* Added extra GUI enhancements such as allowing the user to add a different bee, and added the health bar feature to those bees too
